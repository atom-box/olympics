DUH -- YOUR SYNTAX NEEDED QUOTES AROUND ${}

Start query syntax over again.  Workshop a query that gives correct number of lines, in a column aliased SPORTS.
Change the query to NO MATH.
Make the final function return a NON ZERO count, aliased, even if wrong #.

Play with length of null in the REPL node

Two Possible Solutions to that last step of OLYMPICS:
Zeroeth choice is to count two columns and divide some nonsense.
First choice is to do it as a nested table.  S  F  W  ( s  X AS Y f w); needs nought after parens!

SELECT * AS count FROM ____ WHERE COUNTRY = ____ GROUP BY sportname!  
/*
Returns a SQL query string that will 
find 
the sports 
a country has won medals in. It should include 
the number of medals, aliased as 'count',
as well as 
the percentage of this country's wins the sport represents,
aliased as 'percent'. 
Optionally ordered by the given field in the specified direction.
