# Real Results of the Olympics, Since 1896

## My code
The file that I did all my work in is [sql.js](https://github.com/atom-box/olympics/blob/master/sql.js) 
You can look at the [landing page](https://atom-box.github.io/olympics/index.html) but it is just a static GitPages page, not hooked up to a server right now.
My server at [Digital Ocean](http://littlefurnace.com) can run it...when I get time to set it up.

## Typical Functions
I appreciated working with such an interesting pile of data for this project.  I learned a lot about the Summer and Winter Olympics!
